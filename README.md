SHA-256 Hexadecimal Trippy Animation
This project is a mesmerizing web-based visualization that animates hexadecimal characters derived from the SHA-256 hash of user-inputted text. It leverages the power of p5.js for dynamic graphics and js-sha256 for computing SHA-256 hashes. Users can enter text to generate a corresponding SHA-256 hash, which is then displayed and animated in a trippy, visually captivating manner.

Features
SHA-256 Hash Generation: Enter any text to generate its SHA-256 hash.
Interactive Animation: Watch the hexadecimal characters of the hash dance around the screen.
Copy to Clipboard: Easily copy the generated hash to your clipboard with a single click.
Responsive Design: The animation adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring a great experience on any device.
Bitcoin Symbol: A Bitcoin symbol is dynamically positioned in the center of the animation.
